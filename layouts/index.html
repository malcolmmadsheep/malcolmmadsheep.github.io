      <!-- <p>
        I'm software engineer with a passion to people, technologies and the
        world that surround me. Everyone wants they own place in the Internet
        and I'm not an exception.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like getting to know the world by learning concepts created both by
        people and by nature. I'm assured that the best way to learn any thing
        is to explain it to somebody else.
